# Ramen Timer

This is a simple mobile-first ramen timer web app with a nostalgic, pixel-art aesthetic. It has (cooking) times for my favorite brands which include: Shin, Jin, Samyang, Paldo, Lucky Me!, and Indomie. There is also a timer log you can access by clicking the menu icon to view all your previous completed timers.
